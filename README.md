# Machine_learning
This repo has the machine learning codes links to ITU Mobile Communications Class
The project description can be found in the repo as MobileComm2018_project and the project codes are prepared on MATLAB

In project it had been asked to predict some of columns of the raw data. So we firstly make an prediction algorithm taht works on a more light dataset. The example code and datasets are KNN_Example and veriler.csv

Refinedata.m is used for deleting unnecessary columns of the data.
